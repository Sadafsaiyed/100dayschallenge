Topic - Java Substring Comparison

We define the following terms:
Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:
A<B<......Y<Z<a<b....<y<z
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

-A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.
Given a string,s , and an integer, k, complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length k .
Function Description

Complete the getSmallestAndLargest function in the editor below.
getSmallestAndLargest has the following parameters:
string s: a string
int k: the length of the substrings to find

Returns
string: the string ' + "\n" + ' where and are the two substrings

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting s.
The second line contains an integer denoting k.

Constraints
1<=s<=1000
s consists of English alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).

Sample Input 
welcometojava
3

Sample Output 
ava
wel

explaination- We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).
The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
