Question - Tag Content Extractor

In a tag-based language like XML or HTML, contents are enclosed between a start tag and an end tag like <tag>contents</tag>. 
Note that the corresponding end tag starts with a /.
Given a string of text in a tag-based language, parse this text and retrieve the contents enclosed within sequences of well-organized tags meeting the following criterion:
The name of the start and end tags must be same. 
The HTML code <h1>Hello World</h2> is not valid, because the text starts with an h1 tag and ends with a non-matching h2 tag.
Tags can be nested, but content between nested tags is considered not valid. 
For example, in <h1><a>contents</a>invalid</h1>, contents is valid but invalid is not valid.
Tags can consist of any printable characters.

Sample Input:
4
<h1>Nayeem loves counseling</h1>
<h1><h1>Sanjay has no watch</h1></h1><par>So wait for a while</par>
<Amee>safat codes like a ninja</amee>
<SA premium>Imtiaz has a secret crush</SA premium>

Sample Output:
Nayeem loves counseling
Sanjay has no watch
So wait for a while
None
Imtiaz has a secret crush
